# MST Algorithms
Implementation of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree.

## Current status
**Tests are failing** - I don't know how to solve this problem

## Known Issues
1) Prim's algorithm returns empty MST (0 edges)
2) Kruskal might have similar issues 
3) Null pointer exceptions in edge tracking
